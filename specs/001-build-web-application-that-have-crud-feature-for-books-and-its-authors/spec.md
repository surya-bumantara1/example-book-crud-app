# Feature Specification: Book and Author Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-web-application-that-have-crud-feature-for-books-and-its-authors`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "build web application that have CRUD feature for books and its authors. author can have many books. books must only have 1 author and optionally have 1 co-author. the application must have a way to create, update, delete (soft delete) all books and authors, including changing book author and co-author."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Manage Authors (Priority: P1)

As a content creator, I want to create and manage author profiles so that I can establish authorship for books and track contributor information.

**Why this priority**: Authors are the foundation of the book management system - without authors, books cannot exist in the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating author profiles and viewing the author list, demonstrating that author management works independently of book creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no existing authors, **When** I create a new author with name and bio, **Then** the author appears in the author list with accurate details
2. **Given** an existing author, **When** I update their information, **Then** the changes are reflected immediately in all views
3. **Given** an existing author, **When** I soft delete them, **Then** they are removed from active views but retained in the system for data integrity

---

### User Story 2 - Create Books with Single Author (Priority: P1)

As an author, I want to create books with myself as the primary author so that I can publish and manage my written works.

**Why this priority**: This represents the core book creation functionality and must work independently of co-author features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating books with a single author and verifying they appear correctly in book listings and author profiles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as an author, **When** I create a new book with title, description, and myself as author, **Then** the book appears in my author profile and in the main book listing
2. **Given** an existing book, **When** I update the book details, **Then** all changes are immediately visible across the system
3. **Given** an existing book, **When** I soft delete it, **Then** it is removed from active listings but preserved in the system

---

### User Story 3 - Add Co-Authors to Books (Priority: P2)

As an author, I want to add a co-author to my books so that I can properly credit collaborative work and enable co-authors to manage shared books.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the basic book creation but is not essential for the core single-author book functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding co-authors to existing books and verifying co-authors can view and manage those books.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a book with only a primary author, **When** I add a co-author, **Then** the co-author appears in the book details and can access the book for management
2. **Given** a book with a co-author, **When** I change the co-author, **Then** the new co-author gains access and the previous co-author loses access
3. **Given** a book with a co-author, **When** I remove the co-author, **Then** only the primary author retains management access

---

### User Story 4 - Transfer Book Authorship (Priority: P2)

As an author or administrator, I want to transfer book authorship between authors so that I can handle cases where books need to change primary authors.

**Why this priority**: This supports book lifecycle management but is less common than basic CRUD operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by transferring book authorship and verifying the new author has full management rights while the previous author loses them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a book with a primary author, **When** I transfer authorship to another author, **Then** the new author becomes the primary author and the previous author loses primary authorship rights
2. **Given** a book with both primary and co-authors, **When** I transfer primary authorship, **Then** the co-author relationship remains intact

---

### User Story 5 - Browse and Search Books and Authors (Priority: P3)

As a visitor or user, I want to browse and search books and authors so that I can discover content and find specific authors or books.

**Why this priority**: This enhances discoverability but is not essential for the core CRUD functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching and browsing books and authors independently of creation features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple books and authors in the system, **When** I search by author name, **Then** I see all books by that author
2. **Given** multiple books in the system, **When** I search by book title, **Then** I find the specific book with accurate details

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when trying to delete an author who has existing books?
- How does system handle attempting to assign the same person as both primary author and co-author?
- What happens when a co-author tries to transfer primary authorship?
- How does the system handle searching for soft-deleted items?
- What occurs when multiple users try to edit the same book simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new authors with name and bio information
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to update author information including name and bio
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to soft delete authors while preserving data integrity
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow authors to create books with themselves as the primary author
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow authors to update book information including title and description
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow authors to soft delete their own books
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow primary authors to add co-authors to their books
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow primary authors to change co-authors on their books
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow primary authors to remove co-authors from their books
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow transfer of primary authorship between authors
- **FR-011**: System MUST display books in author profiles showing their authorship role (primary or co-author)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide search functionality for books by title and authors by name
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent a person from being both primary author and co-author of the same book
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain data integrity when authors or books are soft deleted

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Author**: Represents a person who can write books, with attributes: name, bio, creation date, and soft delete status. An author can be associated with many books as primary author and optionally as co-author on other books.
- **Book**: Represents a written work, with attributes: title, description, primary author (required), co-author (optional), creation date, last modified date, and soft delete status. Each book must have exactly one primary author and optionally one co-author.
- **Authorship**: Represents the relationship between authors and books, tracking whether an author is the primary author or co-author of a specific book.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new author profile in under 2 minutes from accessing the system
- **SC-002**: Authors can create and publish a new book in under 5 minutes including adding co-authors if needed
- **SC-003**: Users can find specific books or authors using search in under 10 seconds for typical library sizes
- **SC-004**: 95% of book authorship transfers complete successfully without data loss or conflicts
- **SC-005**: Users can complete common tasks (create, update, search) with 90% success rate on first attempt
- **SC-006**: System maintains data consistency with zero orphaned records when authors or books are soft deleted
