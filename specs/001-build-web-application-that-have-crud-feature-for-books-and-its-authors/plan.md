# Implementation Plan: Book and Author Management System

**Branch**: `001-build-web-application-that-have-crud-feature-for-books-and-its-authors` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [link](../spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-web-application-that-have-crud-feature-for-books-and-its-authors/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a web-based book and author management system with CRUD operations, supporting primary authorship and optional co-authorship relationships. The system will use Nuxt.js for the frontend, Hono.js for the backend, TypeScript throughout, PostgreSQL with an ORM, and Docker for containerization.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Frontend: Nuxt.js 3.x (Vue.js framework), Vue 3, TypeScript
- Backend: Hono.js 4.x (lightweight web framework), TypeScript, Node.js 20+
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+
- ORM: Prisma ORM (popular, type-safe ORM for TypeScript)
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose
- Testing: Vitest (frontend), Jest (backend), Playwright (E2E)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
**Testing**: Vitest for frontend unit/integration tests, Jest for backend testing, Playwright for end-to-end testing
**Target Platform**: Web application (modern browsers), Linux server deployment
**Project Type**: Web application with frontend/backend separation
**Performance Goals**: <200ms p95 response time, support for 1000 concurrent users
**Constraints**: Mobile-responsive design, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), offline capability for read operations
**Scale/Scope**: Support for 10k books and authors, 50 concurrent active users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **All principles satisfied** - No violations detected:
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript with strict typing, ESLint/Prettier enforced formatting
- **Testing Standards**: Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) with TDD approach
- **UX Consistency**: Nuxt.js provides consistent routing and state management, responsive design
- **Security**: Input validation, secure authentication (JWT), HTTPS enforcement, data encryption
- **Documentation**: TypeScript interfaces, API documentation, comprehensive README

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected as it provides clear separation between frontend and backend concerns, enabling independent deployment and scaling. This aligns with modern web development practices and supports the requirement for a full-stack application.
