# Research Findings: Book and Author Management System

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision: Nuxt.js 3.x for Frontend
**Rationale**: Nuxt.js provides excellent developer experience with file-based routing, auto-imports, and built-in TypeScript support. It's ideal for CRUD applications with its composables pattern for state management and server-side rendering capabilities for better performance and SEO.

**Best Practices**:
- Use `useFetch` or `$fetch` for API calls to leverage Nuxt's data fetching utilities
- Implement composables for reusable state logic (e.g., `useAuthors()`, `useBooks()`)
- Use `useHead()` for dynamic meta tags and SEO optimization
- Leverage Nuxt's auto-imports to reduce boilerplate code
- Use `definePageMeta()` for route-specific metadata and middleware

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Next.js: More popular but heavier; Nuxt offers better Vue.js integration
- SvelteKit: Smaller bundle size but less mature ecosystem

### Decision: Hono.js for Backend API
**Rationale**: Hono is a lightweight, fast web framework that works well with TypeScript and provides excellent performance. It's designed for edge runtimes and works perfectly with modern deployment platforms.

**Best Practices**:
- Use Hono's middleware system for authentication, validation, and error handling
- Implement proper error handling with custom error classes
- Use Hono's built-in TypeScript support for type-safe route handlers
- Leverage Hono's adapter system for different deployment targets
- Use Hono's RPC capabilities for type-safe communication between frontend and backend

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Express.js: More mature but heavier and less modern
- Fastify: Good performance but less lightweight than Hono

### Decision: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
**Rationale**: Prisma provides excellent TypeScript integration with type-safe database queries and excellent migration support. PostgreSQL offers robust relational data storage perfect for complex author-book relationships.

**Best Practices**:
- Use Prisma's data modeling for clear schema definitions
- Implement soft deletes using Prisma middleware
- Use Prisma's query builder for type-safe database operations
- Leverage Prisma's migration system for version control of database schema
- Use Prisma Client extensions for custom business logic

**Database Design Patterns**:
- Author-Book: One-to-many relationship (Author has many Books)
- Book-CoAuthor: One-to-one optional relationship (Book has one CoAuthor)
- Use UUID primary keys for better security and scalability
- Implement soft deletes with `deletedAt` timestamp fields

**Alternatives Considered**:
- TypeORM: More complex setup, less polished TypeScript experience
- Drizzle ORM: Lightweight but less mature than Prisma

### Decision: Docker Containerization
**Rationale**: Docker provides consistent development and deployment environments, simplifies dependency management, and enables easy scaling.

**Best Practices**:
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller production images
- Implement proper health checks for all services
- Use Docker Compose for local development with hot reloading
- Implement proper networking between frontend, backend, and database
- Use environment-specific docker-compose files (dev, staging, prod)

**Service Architecture**:
- Separate containers for frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL
- Use named volumes for database persistence
- Implement proper dependency ordering in docker-compose.yml

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
**Rationale**: Provides stateless authentication suitable for modern web applications with good security practices.

**Implementation**:
- Use Hono middleware for JWT validation and refresh
- Store refresh tokens securely in database with expiration
- Implement proper token rotation for security
- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for token storage

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-layer testing approach
- Unit tests: Vitest for frontend, Jest for backend
- Integration tests: Test API endpoints and database operations
- E2E tests: Playwright for complete user journeys

**Best Practices**:
- Test-driven development (TDD) as per constitution requirements
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use Prisma's test database utilities for integration tests
- Implement visual regression testing with Playwright

## Integration Patterns

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- Use Hono's RPC capabilities for type-safe API calls
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Use loading states and optimistic updates for better UX

### State Management
- Use Nuxt's composables for local state management
- Implement Pinia for global state if needed (authors, current user)
- Use TanStack Query (Vue Query) for server state management

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement proper caching strategies (browser cache, CDN)
- Use Nuxt's image optimization for author/book cover images
- Implement pagination for large lists of books/authors
- Use database indexes for common query patterns

## Security Considerations

- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use HTTPS in production with proper SSL certificates
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Deployment Strategy

- Use Docker for consistent deployment across environments
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Use environment variables for configuration management
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts

## Conclusion

The chosen technology stack provides an excellent foundation for building a robust, scalable book and author management system. All technologies are well-suited for the domain and align with the project constitution requirements for code quality, testing, security, and maintainability.
