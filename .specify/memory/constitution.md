# Book CRUD Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
All code MUST follow established best practices for maintainability, readability, and performance. Code MUST be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), follow consistent naming conventions, use meaningful variable names, and maintain a cyclomatic complexity under 10. All functions and methods MUST have a single responsibility and be no longer than 50 lines. Code formatting MUST be enforced through automated tools, and any style violations MUST be addressed before merging.

### II. Comprehensive Testing Standards
Every feature, function, and module MUST have unit tests with minimum 90% code coverage. Integration tests MUST validate component interactions and API contracts. End-to-end tests MUST verify complete user workflows. Test-driven development (TDD) MUST be practiced: write failing tests first, then implement minimal code to pass tests, then refactor. All tests MUST be deterministic, independent, and provide clear failure messages for debugging.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The application MUST maintain consistent UI/UX patterns across all features and pages. User interactions MUST follow platform conventions and accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance). All user-facing strings MUST be internationalized and support multiple languages. Loading states, error messages, and success feedback MUST be consistent throughout the application. User sessions MUST persist appropriately and provide clear logout mechanisms.

### IV. Security Best Practices
All user inputs MUST be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks. Authentication MUST use industry-standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, JWT) with secure token storage. Authorization MUST be implemented at API and UI levels with role-based access control. Sensitive data MUST be encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256). Security headers MUST be implemented, and regular security audits MUST be conducted. Password requirements MUST enforce complexity rules and secure hashing (bcrypt/Argon2).

### V. Documentation Excellence
All public APIs, classes, and methods MUST have comprehensive documentation including parameters, return values, exceptions, and usage examples. Code comments MUST explain complex business logic and non-obvious implementations. User-facing features MUST include help text and tooltips. Architecture decisions MUST be documented in ADR (Architecture Decision Records). A comprehensive README MUST include setup instructions, API documentation, and troubleshooting guides.

## Quality Assurance Standards

All code changes MUST pass static analysis, security scanning, and automated testing before deployment. Performance benchmarks MUST be established and monitored for critical paths. Code reviews MUST be conducted for all changes with at least one approval required. Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed regularly, with no more than 5% growth per sprint.

## Development Workflow

Code reviews MUST focus on correctness, security, performance, and adherence to principles. All PRs MUST include tests and documentation updates. CI/CD pipelines MUST run full test suites and security scans. Hotfixes MUST follow emergency procedures but still maintain testing and review standards. Feature flags MUST be used for experimental features to enable safe rollbacks.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change and rationale
2. Review and approval by the development team
3. Creation of migration plan for existing code
4. Update to this constitution with incremented version number

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity introduced MUST be justified with clear business value. Use project documentation and coding standards for runtime development guidance.
